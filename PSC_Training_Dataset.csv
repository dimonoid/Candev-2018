Good employees doing what they can Work life balance and demanding expectations

The work ethic and team environment at Honeywell is great. Wish they had more room to grow within in the company.

Many recent (last 3 years) changes in organization and leadership and loss of focus on core business and loss of many good people as a result

Greedy Ceo and upper management. Although wages are not bad the company takes and takes from the middle class people who make the money for them. They want to keep them down instead of rewarding them

Benefits are the weak link at Honeywell. HSA plan with very high deductible and high monthly cost. It is only slightly cheaper then going on your own.

Good name recognition. Able to leverage brand recognition. Pretty much everything. Benefits have been stripped to nothing. 18 month long hiring freeze has decimated staff.

Onboarding is non existent. Benefits are horribly expensive for such a large co. No remote working policy is very last century and restrictive. Not risk takers.

Anyone who started with UOP has an axe to grind with Honeywell. Any attorneys sent from Honeywell in MN to work for UOP are the rejects with their own axe to grind. Run as fast as you can.
"Benefits, Benefit, Benefits - the company used to have great benefits. My family is now on my wife's benefits because the Honeywell benefits are too costly. As an employee only I still pay over $6000"
Health Insurance is expensive and they have gotten rid of their pensions.
"I was hired as a remote worker, and accepted the job based on the work from home policy. The company has recently revoked this policy for all workers for no reason. Many of us work globally via Skype,"
The benefits are horrible and the company seems to only care about immediate results not long term success. Furloughs and layoffs galore.

Poor business reputation within Colorado Springs area. Unpleasant place to work due to managers that often act poorly.

The people are great to work with. Aerospace business is losing benefits
Good hands on work experience. Lack of resources and training.
Honeywell purchase of Intermec Technologies created management chaos. Lots of regular layoffs in all locations. New product development being relocated to cheaper labor countries.

"Lots of training, lots of interaction with other interns, gave chances for visibility with upper management. Old Building, no windows and not many places to eat lunch in close proximity."
"Corporate initiatives are one size fits all regardless of need.Financial incentives (raises, 401k, and bonuses) are can be greatly reduced at the corporate level regardless of individual achievement."

A large company with various job options. For the past several years there has been a significant and steady decrease in the appreciation/investment in employees.

Small group under large corporation Limited personal challenge oportunity and creativity
Honeywell Aerospace has lost its focus in the last year. Their focus used to be on the customer and now it is on bonus' for the upper Aerospace management.
"The only Pros are in the past. The company has become cut throat. One word.... the CEO, Dave Cote, has targeted senior staff in the pursuit of the all mighty dollar. He is despicable."
"Profitable, free and friendly atmosphere Poor benefits, low salaries, high expectations for salary"
Strong brand opens doors. Pension and 401k match. Rigid and very risk averse. Lacks flexibility and creative control.

Work on small team with great manager. No employees received raises this year (2016)
Lot of learning and meet new people actually there ara no cons
"Good life and work balance short term vision, next quarter"
No more remote working. No promotions or raises. They do reviews on a bell curve so someone is always getting shafted. Morale is really bad.

Honeywell helped me grow professionally . I learned a lot from a lot of great leaders . Lots of growth opportunity and great pay A lot of fluctuations with the market in aerospace .
40 hr work week. Average salary 12-hour time-zone difference with many teammates.

Great company and a world presence. Management distracted by too many meetings and too much travel.

"During my <2 years as an employee there were 3, week long unpaid furloughs, followed by layoffs. The last of which I was affected by and was let go."
The shareholders' interests are top priority for Honeywell. Shareholders have zero interest in employee well-being; this is detrimental to the culture at Honeywell and therefore employee morale.

"If you like overtime. this is the place Direct manager was inapt, had no people skills. Poor morale."
"Constant layoffs, deteriorating benefits, toxic work environment. More and more work content being sent overseas. Honeywell is really an Asian company with a headquarters in the US."

Good career advancement for hard workers. Multi-industry allows for many different experiences. Frequent reorganizations. Healthcare plan expensive and has low benefits.
"The company is going through a major re-org and they are letting people go, forcing employees to take furloughs, some people forced in to retirement and the benefits are becoming non-existant."
An industry that is difficult to change and modernize. Retiring workforce without new engineers to maintain or improve the product.

Frustrations with management. Changes in my immediate manager and director occurred on an almost yearly basis. The training programs provided did not always pertain to what was need to do the job.
The fundamentally good ideas in processes like Six Sigma are constantly misapplied and product quality is sacrificed in order to meet a schedule.
"Company allows for some flexibility in schedule. With the recent work furloughs and layoffs, there is no job security. As a result, the employee morale is low. High deductible medical insurance."

its voted as the best admired employer. Oil and gas industry has been down and they just had a 5% work load reduction.
It lately has been more stringent with processes that most competent engineers are already familiar with.
Senior leaders are well compensated to deliver strong financial results on the backs of their employees. It finally became too difficult to look myself in the mirror and I left.
"Big company with global presence. Honeywell does not value its employees. All work, all the time. Everyone in replaceable at any time."
Large company is slow to change. Different managers provide different levels of oversight. Company is very slow to promote. Benefits are slowly being reduced. Work/life balance dependent upon manager.

Decent salary and benefits. Long Lowered medical benefits and 401k match

I have been using the same tool for the past 12 years. The company needs to update on their software skill set higher to attract more works.
Good pay. Performance based pay increases based on annual reviews. I really have to think hard. Only 1/2 hr lunch.

Honeywell has a big company feel that can be a negative if you don't like that type of environment. The work/life balance is difficult if you are working on a critical project.

Politics are horrible. If managers don't like you they will plan your exit quicky. Managers are the problem. Dog eat dog world. Benefits are not good at all.

Good work ethics and good working environment.Very safe place to work Not much overtime if that's what your looking for
"If moved up from within, financial growth is a little slower than expected but can be achieved at market level with proven results."
Expected red tape of large corporation. Extensive processes to be followed to fulfill regular tasks. Strategy not always focused.

Too much continually internal change - takes a bite out of qualityRIF - more and more work and multiple job roles transferred to those still here

Decisions made on the corporate level favor the Honeywell shareholder much more than the salaried employee and are by no means consistent. Salaries have just been temporarily reduced by 10%. Lay offs

Things constantly changing and uniforms
Much older community at Honeywell and the aerospace industry in general (many people are ready to retire) - not a lot of peers for the younger crowdNot great benefits
No one goes out of the way to help. They tend to require overtime. Training is LACKING. People will ignore you if you are new.
"Pay, Management, Leadership, Future, Growth Long Hours, Politics, Culture, Morose, Lack of team work"
Nothing good to say about this company. Too much work for the staff. You end up working 12 hour days when you are salaried.

Management not pursuing new work aggressively enough. Engineering management decisions made by people located in another state not local in New Jersey.
I was able to gain a lot of valuable experience there. Nothing bad really. There is no such thing as a perfect job.
"Horrible pay and horrendous benefits which shrink continuously. Micro-managing is the name of the game and they can't make things worse, they look somewhere else. For example, my department has a ten-"
There may be some nepotism. Salaries are below average. The health insurance is terrible. There is a $3000 deductible. Its like not having insurance at all.
Benefits have eroded and performance evaluations do not match merit increases. There are no bonuses and career growth is difficult to come by.
"Job Guarantee , Nice Work environment. Very Conservative policies , Not much growth for employees"

This Company have Good Behaviors This Company can improve their Compensation Plan
Underpaid! Once I looked outside and went on interviews it was very clear how much I was underpaid even after asking for a raise many times. Medical benefits are horrible.
